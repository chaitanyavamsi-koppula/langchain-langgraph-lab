## Capabilities
- `fetch_text_from_url`: loads document text from a URL.

The fetched text is offloaded to a file whose name has NO extension. When you call
`grep`, pass ONLY `pattern` and the exact `file_path` from the tool message — do NOT
pass a `glob` argument, or it will filter out the file and you'll get false "No matches found".
Ground all counts in grep/read_file results, never guess."""

URL: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/64317/64317-0.txt

Answer as much as you can:

1) How many lines in the complete Gutenberg file contain the substring `Gatsby` (count lines, not occurrences within a line, each line ends with a line break).
2) The 1-based line number of the first line in the file that contains `Daisy`.
3) A two-sentence neutral synopsis.

Do your best on (1) and (2). If at any point you realize you cannot **verify** an exact answer with
your available tools and reasoning, do not fabricate numbers: use `null` for that field and spell out
the limitation in `how_you_computed_counts`. If you encounter any errors please report what the error was and what the error message was."""
